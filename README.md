# Project description 
Our project is a web app to store information on different pc builds, and provide a platform for reviewing and testing them. There are multiple components, and each component can be in different builds. Users are able to post reviews of different builds, as well, benchmark tests can be posted for different builds. This will allow users to gather enough information to be well informed when making their PCâ€™s.
